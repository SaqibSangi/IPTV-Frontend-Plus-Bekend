Project Title: IPTV App (Frontend & Backend)

Description: Develop a comprehensive IPTV application that includes both frontend and backend
components. The frontend will be a user-friendly React Native app, offering features such as channel
browsing, live streaming, and video playback. The backend will be a robust server built with Node.js
and Express.js, managing user authentication, content delivery, and metadata handling. This solution
aims to deliver a seamless streaming experience with a modern, responsive interface and reliable
backend infrastructure.
